# Overview

## Problem statement

Terrorism in today's world has generated a distorted fear among citizens, moderates and even the political leaders. With the rising cases, security has become an all-encompassing concern. 

## Proposed work

To increase understanding of these challenges and improve stability of our counter-terrorism approaches, I have addressed and analyzed certain factors with the help of business intelligence tools. 

## Steps Involved

- Importing the data from an external data source
- Cleaning the dataset
    1. Ensured that the data is in a tabular format of rows and columns and removed the null values
    2. Carried out column manipulation and changed with an appropriate names
    3. Carrying out spell check and removing redundancy 
    4. Fixed date and time formats
- Visualizing using IBM Cognos Analytics tool

    Sorted out the charts and infographics that can be used 

    Created separate visuals 

    Combined the visuals in dashboards to form an extensive report 

## Outcomes

An average of 8322 terrorism attacks take place every year 

2016 witnessed 95% higher suicide rate than average 

Major target for terrorists : Private Citizens and property
